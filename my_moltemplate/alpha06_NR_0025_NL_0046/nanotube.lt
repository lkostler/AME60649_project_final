# The "Graphene" unit cell defined in "graphene.lt" lies in the XY plane.
# In the next line, we will create a new version of the graphene unit cell
# which lies in the XZ plane, by rotating Graphene 90 degrees around the X axis:

GrapheneXZ = Graphene.rot(90,1,0,0)

# ------------------ nanotube ---------------

# Now use this to build a simple ("zigzag") nanotube where the long-axis of each
# hexagon is aligned with the tube axis (along the Z direction).  If the 
# cicumference of a "zigzag" nanotube contains N hexagons, then the radius of 
# the tube, R=(W/4)/tan((2*pi)/(4*N)), where W=2*d*sqrt(3)/2, and d = the carbon
# bond length.  If N=14 and d=1.42 Ansgroms then R=5.457193512764 Angstroms
# In the Joly 2011 paper, the tube radii varied between 5.14 and 18.7 Angstroms.
