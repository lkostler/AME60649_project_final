ID:	Unique Identification Number
NR:	Number of unit cells in the Radius of the nanotube
NL:	Number of unit cells in the Length of the nanotube
Ny:	Number of unit cells in the y-direction of the grephene sheet. Nx = Ny-1
R:	Radius of the Nanotube
L:	Length of the Nanotube. z is in [-1/2L, 1.5L] and the nanotube starts at z=0 and goes to z = L.
Lx:	Length of the graphene sheets (and simulation box) in x-direction
Ly:	Length of the graphene sheets (and simulation box) in y-direction
