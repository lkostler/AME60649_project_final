# --------------- Note: -----------------
# The spacing between water molecules does not matter much as long as it is
# reasonable. (I adjusted the spacing try to insure that the waters are spread 
# uniformly throughout the box.  We do not want bubles to form if there are 
# gaps near the XY periodic boundaries.)  We will have to equilibrate it later.
